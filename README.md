# Metatranscriptomics based Microbiome Model Reconstruction
Leveraging patient-specific metatranscriptome to reconstruct and simulate microbiome community model

Abstract
Combining patient-specific metatranscriptomic data with genome-scale metabolic modeling, we explored the metabolic aspects of urinary tract infections (UTIs) from a systems biology perspective. We created tailored microbial community models, each mirroring the metabolic profiles of individual UTI patients. Delving into patient-specific bacterial gene expressions and microbial interactions, we identify metabolic signatures and mechanisms contributing to UTI pathology. We identified several patient-specific metabolites linked to infection that could inform therapeutic approaches. Our research underscores the potential of integrating metatranscriptomic data using systems biological approaches, offering insights into disease metabolic mechanisms and potential phenotypic manifestations. This contribution paves the way for more biologically attuned computational human models, in silico clinical evaluations, and the future of precision urology, especially vital in escalating antibiotic-resistant UTIs.
